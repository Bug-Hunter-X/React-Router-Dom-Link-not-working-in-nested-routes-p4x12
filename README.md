# React Router Dom Link Not Working in Nested Routes

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `Link` component from `react-router-dom` within nested routes.  The `Link` component fails to navigate correctly, preventing proper routing within the application.

## Issue Description

The provided code snippet shows a simple React application with nested routes.  The `Link` component within the `About` component is expected to navigate to the `/` path (Home page). However, it does not function as intended.

## Solution

The issue is resolved by ensuring that the `BrowserRouter` is at the root level of the application and that routes are properly nested within it.  The solution avoids potential conflicts and ensures accurate routing behavior. For more complex scenarios, consider using `useLocation` and `useNavigate` for more control.
